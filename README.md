# CRM Sales Pipeline Dashboard (Power BI)
## üìä Project Overview
<!-- This is commented out. -->
This project analyzes the B2B sales pipeline for a fictional computer hardware company. The goal is to uncover actionable insights across countries, industries, products, and sales agents using CRM data collected from March 1, 2017, to December 31, 2017.

A fully interactive Power BI dashboard was created to help stakeholders monitor sales performance, identify top-performing agents and products, and track conversion efficiency through different sales stages.

## üßæ Dataset Structure
The dataset consisted of five tables, including information about sale pipeline data, accounts data, sale teams, products and Date table.

## üîç Insights Summary

#### Overall Performance
The company has a strong B2B sales pipeline, converting 48% of leads into closed deals, resulting in over $10M in total deal value. However, the 28% loss rate indicates room for improvement in lead nurturing and qualification.

####  Sales Agent Performance
Darcel Schlecht leads in performance, with the highest closed deal value and one of the highest lead volumes, highlighting her strong closing ability. Several other agents show high total leads but lower closed deal values, suggesting potential inefficiencies in follow-up or qualification.

####  Product Performance
The GTX Plus Pro is the top-selling product, generating the highest deal value. In contrast, MG Special ranks lowest, indicating a need to review its positioning or demand. Conversion rates appear relatively balanced across products, showing consistent interest but also hinting at room for differentiation.

####  Industry Performance
Retail stands out with the highest total leads (1,162) and closed leads (662), suggesting strong demand and effectiveness in that sector. Meanwhile, Services and Employment industries show much lower engagement, pointing to potential for better-targeted strategies or product-market fit assessments.

####  Conversion and Loss rates
Conversion and loss rates are fairly stable across different products, sales agents, and countries. While the conversion rate exceeds the loss rate, the gap could be widened further through improved lead scoring, training, and process optimization.

####  Monthly Trends
Closed deal values tend to peak in mid and late year, possibly due to targeted sales campaigns or seasonal demand. The dip in early months may reflect market cycles or limited prospecting activity.

####  Deal Values by Month
Month-by-month deal values show volatility, highlighting the importance of ongoing pipeline monitoring. This trend suggests the need for adaptive sales strategies and proactive risk management to maintain momentum and reduce loss opportunities.

## Recommendations
- **Strengthen mid-funnel engagement strategies** Implement tailored follow-up campaigns, content nurturing, or personalized outreach to move leads from the Engaging stage to Won. Consider automating reminders and using targeted messaging based on lead behavior.
- **Support and upskill lower-performing sales agents** Analyze loss rates by individual agents and identify specific gaps (e.g., objection handling, closing techniques). Provide targeted coaching, shadowing opportunities with top performers, or updated training materials.
- **Leverage top-performing products and reassess underperformers** Invest marketing and sales efforts in high-converting products like GTX Plus Pro, while evaluating the viability of products like MG Special. Consider repositioning, bundling, or retiring low-performing items based on market fit.
- **Adopt segmented outreach strategies using country and industry filters** Use the dashboard‚Äôs segmentation to tailor messaging and offerings for specific industries and regions. Prioritize channels and campaigns in high-performing areas like Retail, and develop localized approaches for underperforming sectors.
- **Monitor monthly trends to align sales efforts with seasonality** Align campaigns, promotions, and resource allocation with months that historically show stronger closed deal performance. For slower months, test new offers or reactivation strategies to boost pipeline activity.
